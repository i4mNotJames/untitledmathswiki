        <p>Addition is a method of increasing numbers in which you add 2 or more numbers together, to create a larger number.</p>
        
        <h2>How to use it</h2>
        <p>Addition can be performed by starting at the first number, and adding 1 the amount of times as the second number.</p>
        
        <h2>Advanced Addition</h2>
        <p>When adding large numbers like 543 and 879, you will need to introduce some new concepts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Digit-Based addition</h3>
                <p>You can add large numbers by adding the digits together. For example: 123 + 456 = 1+4=5, 2+5=7, 3+6=9, so the answer is 579.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Number Carrying</h3>
                <p>When using the above, you may run into digits adding up to a number spanning 2 digits. Because of this, you will need to subtract the first digit (e.g. 14, remove the 1) and add it to the next digit. If there is no next digit, you can make it into a new one.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
